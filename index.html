      <h2>Hello, I'm Thomas</h2>
      <p>I'm 42 and a freelance Jack-of-all-Trades in Software Engineering. In the last 9+ years I could aquire a
        wide range of <a href="#skills">skills</a>, which I am eager to improve continously.
        I care about my colleagues and I am known as a committed team player who supports people. But not only this, I usually do it with joy and fun and laughter!
        What else? In the past I organized company and team events, started a company internal fitness group,
        worked in a Social Committee and an Innovation Team to inspire, motivate and encourage people.
        I like coffee, games, martial arts, and real estates.</p>

        <h3>Software Testing</h3>
        <p>I started my career as a Software Tester. Even though I was in my early 30s already, I was one of the younger employees and could benefit
          from the knowledge and experience of my older colleagues. I was responsible for the whole test process, from requirement analysis to quality assurance in order to deliver well tested high quality products on time.
          It feels good to assure that.

        <h3>Software Test Automation</h3>
        <p>Pretty early on in my career I found my niche in the Software Test Automation. Less manual testing and more automation? Sign me up. It shortens e.g. regression test times
          and is the prerequisite for a reliable CI/CD setup, thus not only enabling faster testing but an overall faster and more reliable development cycle. Awesome!

        <h3>Software Development</h3>
        <p>As a Software Developer I had to break down big requirements to manageable chunks which I planned, designed and implemented as changes and new features.
          Truth is though, that most of my professional development work happened in the Test Automation and as Support Engineer.

        <h3>Agile Coaching</h3>
        <p> Over time I had been Scrum Master for several teams and adapted the Scrum process to their needs.
          I also acted as Agile Coach helping people and teams and reduced the pain of transition to an agile way of working.
