# webCV

## What this is about

HELLO WORLD!

I created this webCV to train and demo my frontend development skills. Starting from simple HTML code the goal is to incrementally add more features using e.g. JS and other tools to have a responsive and good website.

This webCV is currently the best I can do up-to-date regarding frontend development and it is the best I ever did so far. Progress comes from continous learning and implementation.
